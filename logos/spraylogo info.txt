Please note the following for custom sprays:

Each spraylogo has to have a size of 32x32 pixels!
BMP is the recommended format for spraylogos.
You should only use grayscale images for logos!
- Black	-> will become transparent
- Gray 	-> will become semi-transparent
- White	-> will become opaque

WARNING: SPRAYLOGOS WHICH ARE BIGGER OR SMALLER THAN
32X32 PIXELS WILL CAUSE ERRORS! DO NOT USE SUCH
SPRAYLOGOS! THEY WILL KILL YOU! OH - MY - GOD!

WARNING: DEDICATED SERVERS REQUIRE THIS FOLDER IF
SPRAYLOGO TRANSFER IS ENABLED! SO MAKE SURE THAT
IT EXISTS IN THAT CASE!
