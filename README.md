# pcs_mixmatch
This is the git repository for the mixmatch project of the PCS (see www.cs2d.net ).
 
Currently, it's only in the initial state and later on it will be hopefully populated with all sources of the project.

The goal is to reach something like a matchmaking system step by step. More to follow soon.
