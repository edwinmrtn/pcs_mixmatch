©255255255- RCon -
RCon stands for "Remote Control". It allows you to control dedicated servers.

©255255255- Server Setup -
Before you can use remote control you have to set an rcon password.
©255000000Servers without rcon password cannot be remotely controlled!
To set an rcon password you can use the server menu (New Game) or the command "sv_rcon" followed by the password. You can also open sys/server.cfg and enter it there!
©255000000Use combinations of numbers, letters and special characters as password. Never use passwords which are somehow related with yourself/the server!

©255255255- Using RCon as Client -
After setting the rcon password you have to do the following:
- join your server
- open the console
- type: rcon_password YOURPW
- type: rcon YOURCOMMANDS
You have to replace "YOURPW" with the rcon password you set before. "YOURCOMMANDS" has to be replaced with one or more commands you want to execute on your server.

Please note: You only have to use "rcon_password" ONE time after joining the server! Afterwards you can use "rcon" as often as you like.

©255255255- Using external RCon -
It is also possible to use RCon without joining a server:
- find your server in the serverlist
- rightclick it
- click "Remote Control"
- enter the rcon password
- enter your commands
- execute with enter

There are other applications which allow CS2D RCon. You can even write your own one (programming knowledge required). This is what you have to send by UDP:
1 Byte: 1
1 Byte: 0
1 Byte: 242
1 Byte: length of password string (X)
X Bytes: password string, each char one byte (ASCII)
2 Bytes (unsigned short): length of command string (X)
X Bytes: command string, each char one byte (ASCII)

"password string" has to contain the rcon password and "command string" the command(s) you want to execute.

You will then receive answers from the server as UDP packets starting with:
1 Byte: 1
1 Byte: 0

Followed by one or more console output lines with the following structure:
1 Byte: 240
1 Byte: 0
1 Byte: 3
2 Bytes (unsigned short): length of line (X)
X Bytes: line string, each char one byte (ASCII)

The first 3 bytes are for the message type. 240,0,3 is probably the only type you will receive with external RCon.

©255000000Warning: External RCon is always a security risk when used with an unprotected channel (internet). Password and commands are not encrypted. The transmission is not reliable because plain UDP is used.
