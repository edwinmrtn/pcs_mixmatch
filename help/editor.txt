The built in editor allows you to create your own maps very easily!
An editor tutorial is available at:

©255255255- Tilesets -
Tilesets contain the images/textures for your map. They are just big image files with a lot of 32x32 pixel squares. Each tile in a tileset has its own properties. Like wall, floor, water or obstacle. The editor allows you to place the tiles in your map grid.

©255255255- Entities -
Entities are used to tell CS2D where special places are. Like spawnpoints or bombspots for example. Moreover you can use them to add sounds and effects to your map. Each map needs at least spawnpoints for terrorists (Info_T) and counter-terrorists (Info_CT)!
